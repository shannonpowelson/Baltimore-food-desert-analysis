# Baltimore City Food Desert Analysis
## Background
Food deserts are a major problem in Baltimore City, Maryland.  A food desert is described as an area where it is difficult to obtain fresh food.  According to [The Baltimore Sun](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-lyft-grocery-access-20191118-6wf65ioac5dh5hwjcq3trxzmsm-story.html), â€œAbout one in four people in Baltimore lives in a food desert".  One solution is public transportation.  Public transportation exists, but not all of the bus routes are free, thus making the bus trip to the grocery store unaffordable for some people.  Baltimore had attempted to solve this problem by offering [subsidized Lyft rides](https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-lyft-grocery-access-20191118-6wf65ioac5dh5hwjcq3trxzmsm-story.html) to grocery stores, but this has not solved the problem.  It still costs money and not everyone has a smartphone that they can use to order the Lyft.  In this analysis, we take a closer look at these food deserts by mapping the grocery stores, street food vendors, and free public transportation routes.  We also investigate the prevalence of different food sources and the food items sold by street food vendors.
